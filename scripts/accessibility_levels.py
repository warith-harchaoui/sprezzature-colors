accessibility_levels — turn the canonical palette into one accessibility LEVEL.

The house position (see ``references/accessibility-levels.md``) is that the
DEFAULT should be the reasonable, accessibility-conscious standard, and that
stronger or deficiency-specific variants live on top as options rather than as
the price of entry. This module implements that as a single pure function,
:func:`apply_level`, that maps the canonical palette to a chosen level while
keeping the same colour names (so a figure that asks for ``"Blue"`` keeps asking
for ``"Blue"`` and simply receives the level-appropriate hex).

Levels
------
``universal`` (default)
    The curated Colour-Universal-Design-style palette, unchanged. Categories are
    already meant to be separated by lightness and never by hue alone (the
    figures add shape / label / position on top). This is the standard everyone
    gets without opting in.
``high-contrast``
    Each hue is darkened on the OKLCH L axis until it clears the Web Content
    Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) AAA ratio of 7:1 against the background,
    for low vision and hostile lighting.
``monochrome``
    Every colour becomes the grey of its own relative luminance. Categories then
    ride entirely on lightness (plus the figure's shape / label redundancy),
    which is the print and total-colour-blindness case.
``deuteranopia`` / ``protanopia`` / ``tritanopia``
    A palette re-spaced so that, *as that viewer sees it*, every category is
    separated by lightness. Colours are ranked by their luminance under the
    Machado et al. (2009) simulation of the deficiency, then their OKLCH L is
    spread across a legible band (hue and chroma kept). Lightness is the one
    channel that survives every colour vision deficiency, so this guarantees the
    categories stay distinct for that specific viewer. There is no single
    colour-only palette that is optimal for all deficiencies at once, which is
    exactly why these are offered as *choices*, not as the default.

The maths (OKLCH round-trip, WCAG contrast, the Machado CVD matrices) is reused
from :mod:`_colors`, so this module adds no new colour science, only the
level policy. Pillow is not needed: colours are simulated one at a time via
:func:`_colors.simulate_pixel`.
